## SECTING ALL THE COLUMNS IN THE GIVEN TABLE:

SELECT *
FROM
       PortfolioProject.CovidDeaths
WHERE 
       continent is not null 
ORDER BY 3, 4 ;


## SELECTING KEY COLUMNS THAT WILL BE FOCUSED ON:

SELECT 
         Location, 
	 date, 
	 total_cases, 
	 new_cases, 
	 total_deaths, 
	 population
FROM
         PortfolioProject.CovidDeaths
WHERE
          continent is not null 
ORDER BY  1,2 ;


## Q1. Total Cases vs Total Deaths :
-- This shows how amangst those who contacted covid-19, how many actually dies in a country. 

SELECT 
         Location,
	 date,
	 total_cases,
	 total_deaths,
	 (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
FROM
         PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
WHERE
          location like '%states%'
AND 
         continent is not null 
ORDER BY  1,2 ;


##Q2. Total Cases vs Population :
-- This shows the percentage of the population who contracted Covid-19

SELECT
        Location, 
	date,
	Population, 
	total_cases,  
	(total_cases/population)*100 as PercentPopulationInfected
FROM 
        PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths

ORDER BY 1,2


##Q3. Which Countries have the Highest Infection Rate compared to their Population?

SELECT
         location,
	 population,
         MAX(total_cases/population)*100 AS PercentPopulationInfected,
         MAX(total_cases) AS MaxTotalCases
FROM 
        PortfolioProject.CovidDeaths
WHERE  
        continent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1,2 
ORDER BY 
        PercentPopulationInfected DESC


##Q4.Which Countries with Highest Death Count per Population ?

SELECT 
      Location,
      MAX(cast(Total_deaths as int)) as TotalDeathCount
FROM
      PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
WHERE 
       continent is not null 
GROUP BY  
        Location
ORDER BY
        TotalDeathCount desc


##Q5. Which contintents have the highest death count per population ?

SELECT 
        continent,
	MAX(cast(Total_deaths as int)) as TotalDeathCount
FROM 
        PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
WHERE
        continent is not null 
GROUP BY
          continent
ORDER BY 
         TotalDeathCount desc



##Q6.What are the global total cases, total death rate and the global death percentage ?

SELECT 
         SUM(new_cases) as total_cases, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int)) as total_deaths, 
	 SUM(cast(new_deaths as int))/SUM(New_Cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
FROM
        PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
WHERE 
        continent is not null 
GROUP BY
         date
ORDER BY 1,2


##Q7. Create a  View to store data.

CREATE VIEW PercentPopulationVaccinated AS
SELECT
          dea.continent,
	  dea.location,
	  dea.date,
	  dea.population,
	  vac.new_vaccinations,
          SUM(CONVERT(int,vac.new_vaccinations)) OVER (Partition by dea.Location Order by dea.location, dea.Date) AS RollingPeopleVaccinated

FROM 
         PortfolioProject.CovidDeaths dea
JOIN 
         PortfolioProject.CovidVaccinations vac
On      
         dea.location = vac.location
AND     
         dea.date = vac.date
WHERE
        dea.continent is not null
